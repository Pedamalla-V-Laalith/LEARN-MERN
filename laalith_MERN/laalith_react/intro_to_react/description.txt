You are required to run a command in your command prompt to get boiler plate sort of thing installed in your folder
which allows you to do your desired project (it basically makes your life easier)
the command is:- npm create vite@latest
when you run this command it's going to ask you to continue or not just keep pressing yes
it's going to ask you the filename of the project you wanna create, so give the filename too
and then it's going to give you a bunch of options to choose from
since we want to deal with react choose react
and then it's going to ask you for the desired language
choose javascript and then 
and then it's going to ask you to run few commands run them and then you are good to go

the frontend webpage code is written in a file known as App.jsx in src folder
And the contents of App.jsx are styled very nicely using the other files in src folder
now you can modify these files and write your own code so that you will have your own webpage
in order to learn more about how exactly everything happens, dive into the project and learn through exploration.
